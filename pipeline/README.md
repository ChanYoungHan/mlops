v0

⏺ The pipeline v0 implementation is complete! Here's what has been created:

  Core Components

  - collector.py: Generates random data and inserts into PostgreSQL database
  - processor.py: Applies threshold-based classification (HIGH/LOW based on data ≥ 50)
  - dag_inference.py: Airflow DAG for 10-minute scheduled processing
  - docker-compose.yaml: Complete environment with PostgreSQL, Redis, and Airflow
  - init.sql: Database schema initialization with sample data

  Supporting Files

  - requirements.txt: Python dependencies
  - test_pipeline.py: End-to-end pipeline testing script
  - setup.sh: Automated setup script for Docker services

  Usage

  1. Run ./setup.sh to start all services
  2. Access Airflow UI at http://localhost:8080 (admin/admin)
  3. Test manually with python test_pipeline.py

  The pipeline follows your proposal exactly: data collection → threshold inference → database updates, with Airflow orchestration every 10 minutes.
